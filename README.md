# Typing-of-the-Groove

A small rhythm game inspired by the Bust-a-Groove series & the Typing of the Dead series. Use your keyboard to type the required randomly-generated word before pressing the generated letter on the fourth beats of a song.

Programming, design, graphics & menu music by Sherman Fong.

Avatar & dance animations by Kevin Iglesias.

Made with Unity. The code is kind of a mess but feel free to mess around with the source code!
